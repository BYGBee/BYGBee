👋 Hi, I’m @BYGBee or BYG.
Welcome to my private profile!

I'm an embedded software engineer with 10+ years experience in industry 🚀🛰️✈️🤖⚙️ based in Belgium 🇧🇪 (currently... working abroad is so fun! 🇬🇫 🗺️). <br>
I'm active in the DIY/maker community 🛠️.<br>
I'm also a 3d printing enthusiast, a wargame player (40k and OPR mainly), a motorcycle rider 🏍️ and a beekeeper! 🐝 <br>

In this repository, you'll find personnal projects I create on my free time. Obviously, I'll not be able to provide kind of professionnal projects as most are under NDA...<br> 
Feel free to comment on project repos because, as usual in the maker community, C&C WELCOME! 👍

A French/English discord server is in project. Contact me if you are interested.
