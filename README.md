👋 Hi, I’m @BYGBee or BYG.
Welcome to my private profile!

I'm an embedded software engineer 🤖 based in Belgium 🇧🇪 and I'm active in the DIY/maker community 🛠️.<br>
I'm also a 3d printing enthusiast, a wargame player (40k and OPR mainly), a motorcycle rider and a beekeeper! 🐝

In this repository, you'll find personnal projects I create on my free time. Feel free to comment on project repos!<br>
As usual in the maker community, C&C WELCOME!

A French/English discord server is in project. Contact me if you are interested.
