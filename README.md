Hi, I’m @BYGBee (BYG). Welcome to my little corner of the internet!

I’m an embedded software engineer with 10+ years of experience 🚀🛰️⚙️, currently based in Belgium 🇧🇪 (but working abroad whenever I can! 🇬🇫 🗺️).

Beyond my job, I’m a passionate maker and DIY enthusiast 🛠️. I love bringing ideas to life through electronics, 3D printing, and automation. I’m also a wargame player (40k & OPR), a motorcycle rider 🏍️, and a beekeeper 🐝—because why not mix tech and nature?

<b>🌱 Solarpunk Dreamer & Builder</b>

I believe in a future where technology serves sustainability. Whether it’s energy-efficient devices, self-sufficient systems, or just smarter ways to use tech, I aim to integrate solarpunk values into my work.

<b>🔧 What You’ll Find Here</b>

This space is where I share my personal projects—a mix of electronics, automation, and creative problem-solving. Due to NDAs, I can’t showcase my professional work, but I’m always up for discussions!

<b>💬 Collaboration & Feedback Welcome!</b> Just like in the maker community, I love learning from others. Feel free to drop a comment! 👍
